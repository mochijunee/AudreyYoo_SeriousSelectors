  <h2 class = "subtitle"> Possible Movement: </h2>
  <h2 class = "subtitle"> Checkers move diagonally forward by one open space. If your checker makes a JUMP (over one or more adjacent enemy checkers) then you capture those checkers. </h2>
  <h2 class = "subtitle"> As soon as your checker reaches the opposite end of the board, it becomes a King and can move both forward and backward diagonally. If all squares adjacent to your checker are occupied then your checker cannot move. </h2>
